(1977), Keppel and Walter (1999) proposed that, as with rape, sexual murderers are motivated by either anger or, by either anger or power. As is the case with 
the Groth et al. classification system, Keppel and Walter argued that these two sources of motivation combine to form four different themes: PA, P
, : PA, P
R, AR, and AE. However, unlike Groth et al., Keppel and Walter attempted to objectify the classification system by indicat
-ing what specific crime scene behaviors and background characteristics, see Tables 1 and 2 for crime scene variables and background characteristics 

representative of each theme).PA. According to Keppel and Walter (1999), the PA rape-murderer believes in his supe
-riority over others and, , his desire for recognition may be too strong, and he may ultimately share his secret with someone.Keppel and Walter (1999) suggest that the background for the PA killer reflects an emo-tionally primitive individual, . at CARLETON UNIV on February 15, 2013cjb.sagepub.comDownloaded from  8

STICE AND BEHAVIORTHE CURRENT STUDYThe intention of the current study is to empirically examine the classification system proposed by Keppel and Walter (1999) using an approach that is similar to the approach 
previously adopted by Canter et, characteristics of a sample of U.S. serial sexual murderers will be examined for evidence of the four themes proposed by Keppel and Walter. Two specific questions will be addressed:(1) D

METHODDATAThe data used for this study are a subset of data that, specific needs of this investigation. First, all female offenders were removed from the sam-ple, as Keppel and Walter™s (1999) classification system is intended only for the classifica
-
tion of, s (1998) data file were highly specific (i.e., more specific than the general behaviors discussed by Keppel and Walter, 1999), some variables 
were aggregated to form a single variable. For example,, that were used to bind the victim (e.g., bound with rope, bound with 
tape). Keppel and Walter simply refer to a victim being bound so these types of variables 
were collapsed to form single, criteria. The first sample consisted of only those variables that were directly related to the themes described 
by Keppel and Walter (1999). This inclusion method resulted in a sample of 55 crime scene 

variables and, sample was included in this study because there is a high degree of 

overlap in the themes proposed by Keppel and Walter; that is, many of the variables they 

discuss are expected to be present in more, Therefore, the second sample 
consisted of all those variables that were directly related to the themes described by Keppel 
and Walter, but representative of only one particular theme (see variables marked with a 2 in Appendices, .One of the advantages of using PROXSCAL to examine the crime scene and back-ground variables discussed by Keppel and Walter (1999) is that it provides metrics that 
indicate the degree of fit between the plot, if there is evidence of the four themes in the crime scenes and backgrounds 
of the offenders. Should Keppel and Walter (1999) be correct, it is expected that variables  at CARLETON UNIV on February 15,

Walter™s (1999) classification system is the four case studies the authors provided in their, might represent a blow to the proposed classification system, it is important to stress that the conceptual basis of Keppel and Walter™s (1999) system may still 
have some merit. In other words, despite, and AE are valid themes within this context. What the present results may reflect is simply the fact that Keppel and Walter got it wrong when 

they translated 
Groth et al.™s (1977) motivation-, ™s (1977) motivation-based system into a behavior-based model.
For example, Keppel and Walter (1999) may have selected the wrong behaviors to rep-resent each of the four themes, very difficult to select specific behaviors to represent particular themes. If the original set of behaviors focused on by Keppel and Walter failed to capture the essence of the themes proposed by Groth et al. (1977),, the results reported here should come as no surprise. Thus, future research should attempt to recon-
ceptualize Keppel and Walter™s classification system using alternative behaviors to deter-
mine if a greater degree of supporting evidence, could be found for the model.Some might also argue that our failure to find evidence in support of Keppel and Walter™s (1999) model is due to the fact that variables were included in our PROXSCAL, model is due to the fact that variables were included in our PROXSCAL analyses that should not have been. Keppel and Walter might contend that some of the 
variables we analyzed do not perfectly represent the variables contained in, variable ﬁhand/clubﬂ was included in our analysis. This variable was included 
to reflect the fact that Keppel and Walter indicate that serial murder victims will sometimes 
display bruises from ﬁbeating and pummeling.ﬂ However, at no, indicate that serial murder victims will sometimes 
display bruises from ﬁbeating and pummeling.ﬂ However, at no point do Keppel and Walter explicitly describe the variable ﬁhand/clubﬂ as being part of their model.Although we believe that, we believe that the variables included in Samples 1 and 2 are all directly related to the themes described by Keppel and Walter (1999) and reflect fairly the variables 
 Figure 4: PROXSC
AL of Background Characteristics, concerns are valid, the variables included 
in the current analyses that do accurately reflect the themes proposed by Keppel and Walter 

should co-occur with one another more than they do with behaviors/characteristics from 
, analyses even if irrelevant behaviors were included. This was not found to be the case.BACKGROUND CHARACTERISTICS IN KEPPEL AND WALTER™S (1999) MODELAs was the case with crime scene behaviors, the results from this, other important point that is specific to the analysis of the background characteristics that 

should be highlighted.Although Keppel co-developed the classification system tested in this study and was also the creator of the 
HITS database, This created a situa-tion in the current study where variables that might be necessary to meaningfully assess 
Keppel and Walter™s model were not available in the data set. This problem was far more 
pronounced, the background characteristics (compared to crime scene behav-
iors), with many of the characteristics discussed by Keppel and Walter (1999) not existing 
in Godwin™s (1998) data set. For example, Walter (1999) not existing 
in Godwin™s (1998) data set. For example, Keppel and Walter suggest that the AR offender is quick-tempered in his noncriminal life; however, to our, as closely as possible, but of course the 
inability to find support for the four themes proposed by Keppel and Walter (1999) could 
be a reflection of this selection process. Clearly, further research is, research should draw on a set of variables that allows one to directly examine the behaviors and characteristics discussed by Keppel and Walter.AN ALTERNATIVE MODEL OF SERIAL SEXUAL MURDER/MURDERERS?Given the lack of empirical support for Hazelwood and, /disorganized model, Holmes and Holmes™s (2002) motivation-based model, and now 
Keppel and Walter™s (1999) rape-inspired model, an obvious question to ask is whether any, in this study to support the existence of the four themes of 
serial sexual murders/murderers proposed by Keppel and Walter (1999). Although it is 
clear from their study that offenders do exist that fit, sexual murder investigations. Indeed, 
it would be sensible for practitioners and researchers alike to be skeptical of Keppel and 

Walter™s system until future research provides stronger support for the model. It will also be, thrill killer who takes pleasure in the pain and suffering of his victims (Holmes & Holmes, 2002).3.

238,238,"[, In the course of resolving that question, however, Justice Scalia’s opinion questioned the longstanding doctrine of “prudential” standing. What the Court actually did in Lexmark was unsurprising, and its analysis was not at bottom, changes in how lawyers think and (especially) talk about standing.
I. Justice Scalia’s Treatise on Prudential Standing
	Lexmark was a case about laser-printer toner—the powdery ink that normally runs out right, Act.”  
	Federal Courts professors traditionally have taught standing as including two sets of components—constitutional and prudential. The “‘irreducible constitutional minimum of standing,’” deriving from Article III’s “case or controversy”, under Article III to press its false-advertising claims.” Debate thus focused on the second, “prudential” aspect of standing doctrine. That aspect has included three general requirements: “‘the general prohibition on, forum non conveniens.” Because they do not derive (at least directly) from Article III, the prudential rules can be overridden by broad legislative grants of standing to sue.
	Lexmark, however, called this, of standing to sue.
	Lexmark, however, called this structure into question. Finding the label of prudential standing “misleading,” Justice Scalia undertook to “clarify[] the nature of the question at issue, to “clarify[] the nature of the question at issue in this case.” He noted that prudential standing has always been in tension with the principle that “a federal court’s ‘obligation to hear and, obligation to hear and decide’ cases within its jurisdiction ‘is virtually unflagging.’” He might well have added that prudential standing doctrines are often challenged as judge-made law, existing in Griswoldian “penumbras” of Article III, with Congress’s intent in enacting the law in question. The Court quoted Judge Silberman’s observation that “prudential standing is a misnomer” in zone-of-interest cases, because the doctrine inquires whether “this, class of persons ha[s] a right to sue under this substantive statute.”
	Setting aside the “prudential standing” rubric, Justice Scalia concluded that
[T]he question this case presents is whether StaticControl falls within, created merely because ‘prudence dictates.
Despite reframing this as a statutory question rather than one of “prudential standing,” the Court applied the same “zone of interests” analysis that it had pursued in prior, seems relatively straightforward; the interesting questions arise from the Court’s explicit shift away from the traditional rubric of prudential standing. That shift raises a number of questions that are likely to bedevil the lower courts. 
II, heresy at the Supreme Court. But one may fairly read Lexmark as adopting Fletcher’s analysis for purposes of prudential standing. The thrust of Justice Scalia’s opinion, after all, is to replace general, judge-, . It is likely to raise a number of questions:
A.	Will Lexmark govern other aspects of prudential standing?
	As already noted, the zone of interests test upon which the Court focused in Lexmark has, all, have been seen as generally-applicable requirements.
	The Court addressed these other aspects of traditional prudential standing in a footnote.  Justice Scalia suggested that cases raising “generalized grievances” are actually “barred, FEC v. Akins, in which the Court seemed to suggest that the constitutional “concrete injury” and the prudential “no generalized grievances” principles were related but distinct. 
Scalia’s comment is dictum, it strongly, ’s intent with respect to particular statutory schemes.
	

B.	Has the Court created a new rule of prudential standing?
	Traditional accounts of prudential standing feature three general requirements: (1) the rule against third, schemes.
	

B.	Has the Court created a new rule of prudential standing?
	Traditional accounts of prudential standing feature three general requirements: (1) the rule against third-party standing; (2), causation in Lexmark seemed to recognize a principle of general applicability that had not been part of the Court’s prudential standing doctrine. Justice Scalia wrote that “we generally presume that a statutory cause of action is limited to, not apply it particularly strictly in Lexmark. But the Court had never mentioned it before as a part of prudential standing doctrine. Neither does it feature prominently in the Court’s jurisprudence concerning the existence and scope of private, Court’s leading decision cutting back on implied rights of action.
D.	What other effects will making prudential standing concerns part of the merits have?
	The Lexmark opinion identified one important effect of relocating the concerns, of the merits have?
	The Lexmark opinion identified one important effect of relocating the concerns previously considered under prudential standing to become part of substantive analysis of the plaintiff’s cause of action. Justice Scalia noted that “, an easier merits argument, they will be able to postpone consideration of zone of interests (and possibly other prudential standing-type arguments) in this way.
	Perhaps a more surprising consequence would affect federal causes of, this way.
	Perhaps a more surprising consequence would affect federal causes of action litigated in state court. Prudential standing, after all, has generally been justified as part of the federal courts’ inherent authority to control litigation, a broader class of parties or even served up for advisory opinions.
	If principles previously considered part of prudential standing—like zone of interests or the restriction on third parties—are instead part of the underlying federal, also arise whether state courts may take a narrower view of standing in areas previously thought to be governed by prudential principles. After all, state courts generally may not decline to hear federal claims under the rule of Testa, divorced from the merits of the plaintiff’s claims. By acknowledging that fact, at least with respect to prudential standing, Lexmark does hold out hope of placing standing doctrine generally on a firmer footing.]"

After the crisis a consensus has emerged that distinguishes between macro-prudential policy and micro-prudential supervision. According to the 2009 House of Lords Report on EU financial regulation and supervision:
‘Macro, . According to the 2009 House of Lords Report on EU financial regulation and supervision:
‘Macro-prudential supervision is the analysis of trends and imbalances in the financial system and the detection of systemic risks that these, of systemic risks that these trends may pose to financial institutions and the economy. The focus of macro-prudential supervision is the safety of the financial and economic system as a whole – the prevention of the materialization of, the financial and economic system as a whole – the prevention of the materialization of systemic risk.

The focus of micro-prudential supervision is the safety and soundness of individual institutions and also consumer protection. The same or a separate supervisor, functions. If different supervisors carry out these functions they must work together to provide mechanisms to counteract macro-prudential risks at a micro-prudential level’. (House of Lords, 2009)

Macro-prudential policy, out these functions they must work together to provide mechanisms to counteract macro-prudential risks at a micro-prudential level’. (House of Lords, 2009)

Macro-prudential policy, as we explain below,, -prudential risks at a micro-prudential level’. (House of Lords, 2009)

Macro-prudential policy, as we explain below, relies upon many of the instruments used by the micro-supervisory authorities, ELA (Emerging Liquidity Assistance)/LOLR (Lender Of Last Resort). 

As regards the nature of micro-prudential supervision, in a broad sense supervision can be understood as a process with four stages or phases: (, the oversight of financial firms’ behaviour, in particular risk monitoring and risk control, and enforcement. Micro-prudential supervision (the 2nd stage of the supervisory process as defined in the preceding paragraph) is the on-, (“The ESCB shall contribute to the smooth conduct of policies pursued by the competent authorities relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions and the stability of the financial system”). The enabling clause advocated by Tommaso, ECB has been substantially expanded via secondary legislation (the SSM regulation and ensuing normative) into the field of prudential supervision.  

The ECB is no longer just a monetary agency. Since November 2014, the ECB is, ECB is the key supervisory authority for credit institutions in the eurozone. The ECB has also some macro-prudential powers, according to Article 5 of the SSM Regulation, as we further discuss below. And the ECB, , early intervention/PCA, recovery and resolution are not always clear. Given its role as micro-prudential supervisor with powers for early intervention, the ECB is likely to play a major role in the commencement of, relation to which the ECB is the consolidating supervisor, does not meet or is likely to breach the applicable prudential requirements, and, only in the cases explicitly stipulated by relevant Union law for competent authorities, structural changes, monetary policy responsibilities affect the complicated interaction between supervision and resolution?


3. MONETARY POLICY AND MACRO-PRUDENTIAL POLICY
3.1.	Monetary policy before and after the GFC
Prior to the Great Financial Crisis (, has led to a search for a second set of instruments, which have been generically described as macro-prudential instruments.  One major problem is that such macro-pru measures are generally not separate from, but, macro-pru measures are generally not separate from, but overlap with, both monetary policy and micro-prudential instruments.

Thus Sir Jon Cunliffe recently (28 July) stated that there needs to be:
, .  So while the ECB can, and should, aim for a single euro-wide macro-prudential policy, it would seem, at least for the foreseeable future, that macro-pru policies should be, heterogeneous and distinct both across markets and across countries/regions. 
3.2.	Responsibility for macro-prudential policy
This raises the (constitutional/structural) issue of which bodies should be responsible for macro-, (or designated) authority within each Member State took the actual decisions whether, and what, macro-prudential measures to apply;
The EBA attempted to coordinate.
But now the situation has changed. Given, new role in the SSM, the ECB has direct responsibility for monetary policy and ultimate responsibility for micro-prudential supervision. So it must, surely, take a leading role in setting macro-pru which lies in, a range of unanswered questions:
What does the ECB see as its future responsibilities for setting macro-prudential instruments?
What will be the division of responsibility between the ECB and member state authorities for varying macro, ?
What will be the division of responsibility between the ECB and member state authorities for varying macro-prudential instruments?  What will happen if they should disagree?  Will each have a veto, or does, Ecofin?
The ECB can, and will, do its own analysis of the need of macro-prudential supervision and seek to manage coordination among member states.  What role, if any, is then left, ECB to answer.  It should be posed to the EC instead.]
Responsibility for macro-prudential supervision is thus currently shared between the ECB, national authorities/councils of financial stability and the ESRB (, ’s ‘powers’ are limited). 

Besides questions relating to the appropriate allocation of powers for macro-prudential supervision, there are also now a series of questions relating to the ambit of such measures, especially perhaps, financial markets?  This arises with particular relevance in the housing market.  Of the 32 macro-prudential measures reported to the EBA, half related to real estate (op cit Table 2, p. 13), finance, e.g. add-ons for risk weights.  Does the proper dividing line occur between macro-prudential measures, such as requiring a change in loan-to-value (LTV) or loan-to, the post-GFC allocation of responsibility for financial stability, and for the manipulation of micro and macro-prudential instruments, a far wider allocation of non-traditional operational functions to Central Banks.  It has been, can any generic principles, basic rules, be obtained to set the limits for Central Bank (macro-prudential) operations in pursuit of financial stability?

“Monetary policy not only affects inflation rates, but the price (, plan in March 2015 stressing the links between the 3Ms: Monetary policy, macro-prudential and micro-prudential supervision.  
“Monetary policy not only affects inflation rates, but the price (and thus the amount, process, while the key challenge for the ECB is to understand the interaction between monetary policy, macro-prudential policy, micro-prudential supervision and resolution. The ECB is now the key supervisory authority in the eurozone, challenge for the ECB is to understand the interaction between monetary policy, macro-prudential policy, micro-prudential supervision and resolution. The ECB is now the key supervisory authority in the eurozone/SSM. Supervision is, micro and macro, but responsibility for the latter is shared with the ESRB and national authorities. Macro-prudential measures sit in-between monetary policy and micro-supervision. 
The banking system is strongly linked to, other non-bank SIFIs. This gives grounds for discussion about the limits of the ECB’s macro-prudential powers as well as measures and instruments that can be used in the pursuit of financial stability and cooperation with, and supervision”.

needed 
with ready access to information for purposes of macro

 A further complexity is the international nature of such networks.  As many 
counterparties may, -
counter derivatives start being c

A very important

Who should be the Macro

basic purpose of macro

to measure and regulate risks 
relating to the 
entire 
financial system, such fragmentation, .

The disc

important links between monetary poli
cymaking, financial regulation, and

Against this background, it is important to,

aspects of regulation such as capital requirements and their calculation, but the

The Basle Committee crafted an international consensus

IMF Working Paper AFR  Prudential regulations on liquidity risk in developing countries: A case study of Rwanda   
Prepared by Sarah Sanya, Wayne, Mitchell and Angelique Kantengwa 
1 Authorized for distribution by Peter Allum   
January 2012 Abstract This paper analyses the prudential liquidity management framework, in particular the 
quantitative indicators employed by the central bank of Rwanda in response to, regulatory framework. 

Using data from 2006 to 2009, we test the r
obustness of this new prudential regulatory framework to retroactively assess whether it w
ould have helped in predicting the liquidity crisis. Specifically,, crises in 
2008/09. We believe the tests could be applied successfully to determine the adequacy of the 
prudential liquidity regulation of banking systems in developing and emerging economies 
with characteristics simila
r to that of Rwanda, , BIS 2008, and ECB 2008). It recommends that th
e NBR direct policies toward strengthening prudential regulations, bank supervision and its capacity 
for liquidity forecasting. The paper further 
recommends that the NBR, .  B.   Assessment of the NBR™s Liquidity Risk Monitoring Ratio 
The NBR™s preferred prudential liquidity ratio is th
e ratio of liquid assets to total deposits. In 
this section, we, ) remained low enough to c
ontinually signal liquidity shortage in the banking system.
16    
The prudential liquidity ratio (the ratio of loans to deposits) remained well above the 20 
percent minimum threshold during, shrank 
during the crisis.  
  15   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
Banks are more likely to adjust their portfolio 
if the prudential liquidity indicator is the quick 
ratio with a minimum threshold between 70 and 
90 percent. Compliance with, 
liquid assets to meet net cash outflows for 
a 30-day period.  
 
 
 Comparing our estimate of the prudential li
quidity indicator to official estimate by 
the National Bank of Rwanda (
NBR) 
  The, effect of quantitative indicators 
The NBR should design quantitative indicators with the aim of ensuring that compliance with 
prudential requirements is achieved through length
ening the duration of assets and liabilities as opposed to simply holding more liquid, 2008/09 endogenous factors sparked a domestic liq
uidity crisis in Rwanda. In response, the NBR redesigned its prudential regulations on liquidity risk management.

1     INTRODUCTION     

      QUESTIONS AND RESPONSES


Q1, that the intention of introducing the PSB  is  to  move
      from the transitional stage of Interim Prudential  Sourcebooks,  which
      recognises the realities of the existing  regulatory  position,  to  , realities of the existing  regulatory  position,  to  a
      fully integrated risk based approach to prudential  supervision,  then
      the only logical outcome would be to defer implementation of  the  PSB, for smaller firms.  We appreciate that  FSA  is  seeking  to
      move away from prudential rules which are sector-specific, but,  since
      our model classifies the rules for each type, 
      have three specific areas in mind; first, the number of staff expected
      to be employed on prudential compliance; it is not clear  whether  the
      estimated number includes  finance  staff  or, by subjective terms  such
      as those mentioned.

      The fourth part of this question is addressed to Prudential Category 5
      firms (IFAs with no client money).  It is outside the  scope  , end
      of (3).  However, PRAG 5.5.3 G states (wrongly) that in the prudential
      returns the value of  the  derivative  is  to  be  attributed  to  , with  liabilities,  for  example,  guaranteed  annuity
      options.









      PRAG 6 - Prudential Systems and Records

      Overview

4.15  

The ABI’s general impression is that the content is appropriate  ,  of  large  groups  is  not
      necessarily organised on a legal entity basis, and prudential  systems
      and controls may be demonstrated through various organisational layers
      and committees.   Provided  these, with PRAG 6.8.3 G, in relation to  FSA’s  expectation  that
      firms  in  Prudential  Category  2  will  establish  a  separate  risk
      assessment function.  Whilst, with PRAG6.8.3G, in  relation  to  FSA’s  expectation  that
                       firms in
Prudential Category 2 will establish a separate  risk  management  function.
                       We
believe that risk is, the answer is yes, and the  intentions  are  clear.
      To the extent that the Prudential Category may be dependent  upon  the
      Part IV permission held by a firm, it may not, such  as
      those mentioned.

4.25  The fourth part of this question is addressed to  Prudential  Category
      5 firms (IFAs with no client money).  It is outside the scope of, on  material  in
      SYSC, by setting out the relevant systems and controls requirements in
      the prudential context?

4.28  The guidance provided in PRAG 6 does give  an  adequate  expansion  , requirements  should  not  cause  difficulties  for
      insurers, since most records of a  prudential  character  are  already
      subject to a  six  year  retention  period  under, the  reinvestment  rate
      restriction. This is more stringent than is the case under the Interim

one of our cerebral hemispheres, the selfish or self-interested  kind
most of us experience, it is a conceptual truth that prudential concern  and
selfishness is interest in one’s own  welfare.  Since  one  does, , in our survival, that gives  us  a  reason  for  special
anticipatory or prudential concern.”[xix]  He  insists  that  what  we  care

      Fission presents us with a case of quasi-prudential concern that would
be basically no different from the concern  that  the  stroke  victim  , we may be misled  in  the  nonfission  transplant  cases.  Our
quasi-prudential concern falsely leads us to believe that the being we  care
about is a future being with which,  we  had  persisted.
Unger doesn’t need to show that there is no quasi-prudential  concern,  only
that it is less than that felt in cases of survival. In  , that is just one cell different from ourselves.  Although  we
would still project considerable quasi-prudential concern  for  this  future
being which contains all of our brain but the one crucial cell, fails  to
be preserved.
      My view of Unger’s spectrum thought experiment is that our  prudential
or quasi-prudential concern doesn’t track our identity,  rather  it  is  the, preserved.
      My view of Unger’s spectrum thought experiment is that our  prudential
or quasi-prudential concern doesn’t track our identity,  rather  it  is  the
other way around., only  given  this  assumption  that  it  follows  that  our  utmost
prudential concern and our identity will not diverge.
      Unger’s thought experiment is thus  less  successful  ,  about  our  continued
existence which is then followed by a change  in  quasi-prudential  concern.
What Unger needs is a clear point at which we don’t exist  any  , .  Unger  has  matters
backwards.

selfish) way as much about  its  own  survival  as  it, about  its  own  survival  as  it  cares  in  a  quasi-

      The,  of  a  person,  that  cares  more  in  a  quasi-

      Assuming that  the organism can really think, person, then we have  good  reason  to  believe  that  such  quasi-
prudential  concern  is  not  an  accurate  guide  to  where  each  organism, the
transplanted cerebrum and left the organism behind. But  once  the  intimate
connection between prudential concern and identity is undermined, we  become

In this context, the ICCR has produced this report, which discusses how, credit reporting already plays a significant role in supporting financial sector regulation and supervision, both from the micro-prudential perspective as well as from a macro-prudential angle. 
Financial sector regulators and supervisors worldwide have shown, financial sector regulation and supervision, both from the micro-prudential perspective as well as from a macro-prudential angle. 
Financial sector regulators and supervisors worldwide have shown a strong preference for sourcing the data they need, a whole. This is why policy-makers and academic circles alike have been developing a complementary macro-prudential approach to financial supervision and regulation. Hence, as part of this complementary approach central banks and/or other financial, from a systemic perspective. Moreover, credit data from these sources is crucial for the calibration of macro-prudential policy regulations or measures (e.g., counter-cyclical capital buffers, or quantitative limits to certain key ratios, credit bureaus and commercial credit reporting companies to obtain the data they need to discharge their micro- and/or macro-prudential responsibilities. Depending on a number of factors, data in these CRSPs may be sought as a complement to, that is effective in supporting central banks and other regulators/supervisors in discharging their respective micro- and macro-prudential supervisory and regulatory responsibilities. The specific focus of this report is on how the various types of CRSPs are, databases play in this regard. Chapters III and IV analyze, respectively, the data needs of micro-prudential financial supervisors and macro-prudential financial sector authorities, with a special focus on how such data is sourced, Chapters III and IV analyze, respectively, the data needs of micro-prudential financial supervisors and macro-prudential financial sector authorities, with a special focus on how such data is sourced from CRSPs as well as on, providing comprehensive, high-quality credit data, which serves as a crucial input for micro- and macro-prudential regulation and supervision, as well as for other public sector functions (e.g., production of certain macro statistics, purpose of a credit registry (CR) is precisely to support banking and broader financial micro- and macro-prudential regulation and supervision, and through this means assist in preserving financial stability. Therefore, CRs typically collect credit, more generally, and also as a result of new regulatory/supervisory paradigms. For example, micro-prudential supervision evolved from being largely an ex-post, regulatory compliance-focused (audit-like) activity, early 1990s, to a more prospective/forward-looking, preventive function. Likewise, a macro-prudential approach to financial supervision has been under development over the last several years to complement micro-prudential supervision., macro-prudential approach to financial supervision has been under development over the last several years to complement micro-prudential supervision. Box 3 contains a brief discussion on micro- versus macro-prudential supervision.

Further, the most recent financial crisis unveiled a number of data gaps that hindered effective supervision, , iv) Need to improve the communication of official statistics.
Box 3: Micro- versus macro-prudential supervision: potential differences, tensions and complementarities
Micro- and macro-prudential policies share a number of instruments, 3: Micro- versus macro-prudential supervision: potential differences, tensions and complementarities
Micro- and macro-prudential policies share a number of instruments but have a different, albeit complementary, focus. The main focus of, a number of instruments but have a different, albeit complementary, focus. The main focus of micro-prudential supervision is to safeguard individual financial institutions from idiosyncratic risks and prevent them from taking too much risk. By, individual financial institutions from idiosyncratic risks and prevent them from taking too much risk. By contrast, macro-prudential policy focuses on the stability of the financial system as a whole. 
Conceptually, intermediate macro-prudential, prudential policy focuses on the stability of the financial system as a whole. 
Conceptually, intermediate macro-prudential objectives for the financial system relate to financial risks faced by individual financial institutions. For example, endogenous credit, credit and liquidity risk in individual institutions: Credit booms are not necessarily a source of concern for micro-prudential supervision, as banks, taken in isolation, look healthy during boom periods. Likewise, fluctuations in market, set of tools. To give an example of complementarity: the counter-cyclical nature of some macro-prudential measures may have the unintended effect of leading banks to collectively take on risk ex ante. Micro-prudential, prudential measures may have the unintended effect of leading banks to collectively take on risk ex ante. Micro-prudential measures may deter such collective behavior by preventing excessive risk-taking at the level of individual banks.

Micro-prudential supervision can help fix the problems and incentives caused by macro-prudential problems by enforcing requirements at the level, moral hazard” problems. Micro-prudential supervision can help fix the problems and incentives caused by macro-prudential problems by enforcing requirements at the level of individual institutions.
Tensions between the two approaches may arise primarily, requirements at the level of individual institutions.
Tensions between the two approaches may arise primarily because micro-prudential supervision does not necessarily internalize the potential adverse effects that it may have at the macroeconomic scale. Frictions between, internalize the potential adverse effects that it may have at the macroeconomic scale. Frictions between micro and macro-prudential policies are most likely to emerge during downturns. For example, during a downturn, the desire to increase, desire to increase the capital buffers of individual banks to protect them against future credit losses (a micro-prudential concern) can – in aggregate – have negative pro-cyclical effects on credit growth to the economy (, – in aggregate – have negative pro-cyclical effects on credit growth to the economy (a macro-prudential concern).

The actual financial supervision model implemented in a country, including its degree of technical sophistication
, derived from such core tasks. This report follows this alternative approach. 
In this context, micro-prudential financial supervisors have a key interest in the overall quality of the loan portfolio of individual regulated institutions. Hence, group reviews and stress tests at the level of individual financial institutions. These core analytical tasks for micro-prudential supervision and the underlying credit data needs, and especially how such data is sourced from CRSPs and the obstacles, and the obstacles to effective usage are discussed in chapter III of this report.
Implementation of macro-prudential supervision policies has increased demand for data relevant for financial stability analysis. Macro-prudential supervision focuses on the, Implementation of macro-prudential supervision policies has increased demand for data relevant for financial stability analysis. Macro-prudential supervision focuses on the monitoring and managing of the build-up of risks to systemic financial stability, which, , which are very often generated endogenously during so-called “credit booms”. Hence, macro-prudential authorities are typically interested in analyzing system-wide phenomena such as potential excessive credit growth that may be driving, .

III.1 Micro-prudential financial supervision, its evolution and changing data needs
While it is not the objective of this report to, and changing data needs
While it is not the objective of this report to describe in detail micro-prudential financial supervision activities, providing an overview on the evolution of these activities is nevertheless deemed useful to understand how, institutions that lend money as their core business.
As mentioned earlier, the primary interest of micro-prudential banking supervision is on preserving the soundness and stability of individual banks and other regulated lending institutions. Until a, financial crisis. And so, Basel III replaced Basel II. Basel III not only enhanced the micro-prudential framework, but with the countercyclical buffer it also introduced the first international agreement on a macro-prudential tool, -prudential framework, but with the countercyclical buffer it also introduced the first international agreement on a macro-prudential tool.

III.2 Credit data needs for micro-prudential supervisors: Core analytical supervisory tasks with regard to lending risks
As discussed in chapter II of this report, risks
As discussed in chapter II of this report, by identifying the core analytical tasks that micro-prudential financial supervisors perform on a regular basis in a modern regulatory and supervisory regime, it is possible to obtain, reports of the lender. 
Other analyses such as peer group reviews are also used by many micro-prudential supervisors to better contextualize what is observed at the entity-level. These analyses are performed on a regular, be consistently compared across peers, and also defining acceptable levels of deviation from such benchmarks.
Micro-prudential supervisors also perform a series of analyses for certain specific and/or discretionary purposes, performed at irregular intervals or on, Considering the nature and objective of this report, the above discussion on the analytical tasks performed by micro-prudential supervisors has focused on loan portfolio analyses that can be performed using credit data obtained from CRs, CBs or, performed using credit data obtained from CRs, CBs or CRCCs. It needs to be emphasized that micro-prudential supervisors actually perform several other analyses both in connection with lending risks (e.g. review of corporate governance in general, regulated financial institutions. 


III.3 Typical problems that CRSPs face for making available the credit data that micro-prudential supervisors require for their analyses
As stated in the GPCR report, “Information quality is the basic building, up to date…”. This means that data quality is one of the key challenges that micro-prudential supervisors face in order to be able to produce meaningful and consistent results from their various analytical tasks. 
, various variables and concepts correctly and consistently and source the data under high quality standards and procedures, micro-prudential supervisors may still face challenges to obtain some of the data they need due to the CRSPs’ own limitations,, are currently undergoing a modernization effort with this specific purpose in mind. 
III.4 Typical problems that micro-prudential supervisors face with regard to being able to effectively use credit data in CRSPs
Even if all the credit, other credit databases they themselves operate.
When it comes to cross-border lending activities, micro-prudential supervisors may not be able to obtain and use credit data available in foreign CRs or other CRSPs. This, as well as adequate technological tools to make effective use of the data.


Data needs of macro-prudential financial authorities: The role of credit reporting service providers 
IV.1 Macro-prudential supervision: a new role, Data needs of macro-prudential financial authorities: The role of credit reporting service providers 
IV.1 Macro-prudential supervision: a new role for credit data collected by CRSPs
The most recent financial crisis made it evident, individual financial institutions did not ensure the stability of the financial system as a whole. Hence, macro-prudential supervision has emerged as a complement to micro-prudential supervision. Its focus is on monitoring and managing the, financial system as a whole. Hence, macro-prudential supervision has emerged as a complement to micro-prudential supervision. Its focus is on monitoring and managing the build-up of risks to systemic financial stability,, institutions, as well as the feedback loops of the financial sector with the real economy. 
Macro-prudential supervision aims at having a preventive effect. Its first objective is therefore systemic risk detection through the analysis of, detection through the analysis of a variety of data sources.  In addition to this, the macro-prudential supervisory framework entails the design and implementation of specific instruments or measures to enable authorities to address and mitigate the, of risks to systemic financial stability. For example, the Basel III Accord included tools with a macro-prudential dimension (i.e. the countercyclical buffer) designed to address systemic risk. 
More often than not, risks, risk-taking behavior may generate on the economy as a whole. Hence, implementation of the macro-prudential policy framework into central banks and other supervisors’ routine activities has increased the demand for credit data that can be, used to analyze financial sector lending activity from a systemic perspective.
IV.2 Credit data needs for macro-prudential authorities: Core analytical supervisory tasks with regard to assessing overall financial stability
As mentioned earlier, the macro, : Core analytical supervisory tasks with regard to assessing overall financial stability
As mentioned earlier, the macro-prudential supervisory framework comprises systemic risk detection through analysis, and systemic risk mitigation through policy measures. At the risk, focus, when it comes to analyzing risks in lending the analytical categories that are of interest for macro-prudential authorities are similar to those of micro-prudential supervisors. 
Therefore, credit data collected on a regular, lending the analytical categories that are of interest for macro-prudential authorities are similar to those of micro-prudential supervisors. 
Therefore, credit data collected on a regular basis by CRs, CBs and CCRCs can also, , it should be noted that centralized credit databases are only one of the data inputs in the macro-prudential framework. Adopting a system-wide perspective requires inputs from many sources. For example, in addition to, example, in addition to making an informed assessment of the financial position of households and enterprises, macro-prudential analysis also entails the monitoring of high frequency financial market data, systemic liquidity conditions, macroeconomic data, and, among other variables.
IV.3 Typical problems that CRSPs face for making available the credit data that macro-prudential authorities require for their analyses
Performing analyses from a macro-prudential angle may be wrongly associated with requiring, available the credit data that macro-prudential authorities require for their analyses
Performing analyses from a macro-prudential angle may be wrongly associated with requiring aggregate data only. This is clearly not the case, as significant, clearly not the case, as significant advantages have been identified in using information on individual banks for macro-prudential purposes in addition to aggregate-level information, as the latter can hide potentially important situations and developments., , as the latter can hide potentially important situations and developments.
Apart from the fact that macro-prudential authorities require both aggregate and micro-data just like micro-prudential supervisors do, it is to be, Apart from the fact that macro-prudential authorities require both aggregate and micro-data just like micro-prudential supervisors do, it is to be noted that the underlying credit data items relevant for both micro- and macro, do, it is to be noted that the underlying credit data items relevant for both micro- and macro-prudential supervision are in essence the same. Hence, the problems that macro-prudential authorities face in sourcing the, both micro- and macro-prudential supervision are in essence the same. Hence, the problems that macro-prudential authorities face in sourcing the data they need from CRSPs are also similar to those described in section III.3 for, data they need from CRSPs are also similar to those described in section III.3 for the case of micro-prudential supervisors. Those problems will not be repeated here. This section focuses on potential additional challenges for macro-, supervisors. Those problems will not be repeated here. This section focuses on potential additional challenges for macro-prudential authorities.
With regard to CRs’ limitations on coverage, one specific limitation that is especially noteworthy for macro, .
With regard to CRs’ limitations on coverage, one specific limitation that is especially noteworthy for macro-prudential purposes is that many CRs only collect data from banks and in some cases also from a few other regulated, , health insurance and others. Hence, CBs and CCRCs can in principle be especially useful for macro-prudential authorities.  
Analysis of potential contagion effects/interconnectedness might also be especially difficult or even not possible if, basis with other group companies.
Cross-border lending activity is also of special interest to macro-prudential authorities. Data on loans made by foreign lenders to resident financial institutions, households and real sector firms is, border credit data exchanges.
At this point, it needs to be noted once again that macro-prudential authorities’ data needs go well beyond credit data in relation to lending. An issue worth mentioning is the extent, the data which is held by credit reference agencies and lenders to assist with the BOE's macro and micro prudential supervisory activities.

IV.4 Typical problems that macro-prudential authorities face with regard to being able to effectively use credit data in CRSPs
As with micro-prudential, prudential authorities face with regard to being able to effectively use credit data in CRSPs
As with micro-prudential supervisors, a variety of legal and operational problems may prevent macro-prudential authorities from being able to use, CRSPs
As with micro-prudential supervisors, a variety of legal and operational problems may prevent macro-prudential authorities from being able to use credit data available in CRSPs in an effective manner. Once again, the, an effective manner. Once again, the issues already identified in section III.4 for the case of micro-prudential supervisors are also applicable in general terms to macro-prudential authorities will not be revisited here. Some of, in section III.4 for the case of micro-prudential supervisors are also applicable in general terms to macro-prudential authorities will not be revisited here. Some of the additional potential challenges for macro-prudential authorities are discussed, to macro-prudential authorities will not be revisited here. Some of the additional potential challenges for macro-prudential authorities are discussed below.
Data on cross-border lending activities, as mentioned earlier, is crucial, below.
Data on cross-border lending activities, as mentioned earlier, is crucial for macro-prudential authorities, and several important dimensions of such activities are only captured by CRSPs located in the jurisdiction where the, the jurisdiction where the lender is incorporated. CRSPs in foreign jurisdictions are not easily accessible to local macro-prudential authorities. 
At the operational level, it is very likely that the implementation of a macro-prudential, prudential authorities. 
At the operational level, it is very likely that the implementation of a macro-prudential framework will impose new and complex demands on the functionalities of CRs and their supporting human and technical infrastructure., to be updated more frequently. In addition, many of the analyses that are especially useful for macro-prudential policymaking require the ability to break down the available data into smaller parts and being able to examine it from, said with regard to the possibilities of exploiting the data that is obtained from CBs and CCRCs for macro-prudential analytical purposes. 
In this context, the analysis of debt service ratios can be mentioned as an example, addition to the data needed to actually calculate them, for these indicators to be truly useful for macro-prudential policy it should be possible to segment them in a number of different dimensions, for example to identify specific, protection, and competition in the market place. 
One of the main roles of micro and macro-prudential supervisors is the enforcement of these rules. Moreover, many supervisors have regulatory powers (i.e. powers to refine, in the making of these regulations. However, just like it is the case with micro- and macro-prudential supervision, at present in many jurisdictions there is an unprecedented demand for granular credit data to assist in regulation, on the usage of credit data obtained from structured sources, such as CRSPs.
On the micro-prudential side, the use of internal credit ratings is being increasingly promoted for regulatory purposes, in part to reduce, but also with any other institution that has granted credit to that counterparty.
Also in the micro-prudential space, credit data can assist in calibrating regulatory measures intended for individual banks/other credit institutions in which, risk levels and/or practices have been identified through stress tests or other means.
With regard to macro-prudential aspects, credit data has proved crucial and is therefore increasingly used for the design and calibration of policy measures, credit data has proved crucial and is therefore increasingly used for the design and calibration of policy measures (i.e. prudential instruments and tools) aimed at mitigating systemic risk. Examples include:
Setting quantitative limits on loan-, limits
In addition to or in lieu of the countercyclical capital buffer (CCB), some macro-prudential authorities may use sectoral capital requirements (SCR) as an instrument to tackle cyclical risks. In terms of, . It may also need looking at high LTV or high LTI ratios.
Also in the macro-prudential context, credit data from CRSPs, especially from CBs and CCRCs, can be useful for authorities in designing, non-financial institutions (i.e. so-called shadow banking).
While this report focuses on the prudential regulation of financial institutions, it needs to be noted that credit data is also frequently referred to or is, data
Where credit risk is concerned, whilst the types of analytical tasks performed by regulators, micro-prudential supervisors and macro-prudential authorities will differ due to the specificity of their respective duties and responsibilities, the, is concerned, whilst the types of analytical tasks performed by regulators, micro-prudential supervisors and macro-prudential authorities will differ due to the specificity of their respective duties and responsibilities, the underlying credit data items used, such analyses are in essence the same. More specifically, for regulation-making purposes in the micro-prudential environment, regulators are interested in basically the same credit data items as micro-prudential supervisors. Likewise,, in the micro-prudential environment, regulators are interested in basically the same credit data items as micro-prudential supervisors. Likewise, for regulations intended to tackle macro-prudential aspects with regard to credit risks, the, the same credit data items as micro-prudential supervisors. Likewise, for regulations intended to tackle macro-prudential aspects with regard to credit risks, the underlying credit data items needed by regulators are practically the same as, risks, the underlying credit data items needed by regulators are practically the same as those used by macro-prudential authorities when performing their analyses.
As a result of these similarities, the typical problems that CRSPs face, these similarities, the typical problems that CRSPs face to make available the necessary data for micro and macro-prudential supervision and which were identified respectively in sections III.3 and IV.3 are also applicable to the case of financial sector, of financial sector regulators. So are the legal, operational and other problems that prevent micro- and macro-prudential authorities from being able to use credit data available in CRSPs effectively and which were identified in sections III.4 and, emphasizing that for financial sector regulation-making, as it has already been identified for micro and macro-prudential supervision, there is an ever growing need for granular data on the one hand, and on the other, sophisticated analytical techniques for use in financial sector regulatory and supervisory tasks, both from the micro- and macro-prudential perspectives, continue to emerge. These are allowing financial sector authorities to enhance the depth of the various analyses, to and facilitate many financial stability objectives, including: improved risk management; better assessment of micro and macro prudential risks; facilitation of orderly resolution; containing market abuse and curbing financial fraud; and enabling higher quality and, .

 the evening of 26 February 2010, it became apparent to Prudential that a

Notwithstanding

transaction
 announced by 
Prudential
, completion of which was conditional on regulatory approval
. Those 
  10 issues therefore had to be, the deal (including the legitimate interests of overseas 

authorities).  It 
was therefore agreed that Prudential would not publish its rights 

issue prospectus until it had received confirmation that the FSA would not be 

, event, by 5 May 2010 (the date scheduled for p
ublication of the 
prospectus), Prudential 
was 
unable to satisfy Supervision that the enlarged group 
would have a sufficiently resilient financial position,, meet potential capital demands 

which might arise in other areas of the group.  As a consequence, Prudential was 

unable to publish its prospectus by the scheduled date.  The delay contributed to 

the considerable,  The prospectus was ultimately 
published on 18 May 2010.
 4.33. On 1 June 2010, Prudential issued an announcement to the market, noting a prior 

announcement by AIG to the effect that it would, that it would not consider a revisio

regulatory obligations under Principle 11 should be considered.  That is, 

Prudential asserted that the allegation that it was in breach of Principle 11 is also 

wrong on the facts., mu
st be notified to 
the FSA.  PAC 
did 
not dispute that the fact Prudential was entering into a 
substantial transaction 
involving AIA would be information which 

Supervision would ﬁreasonably expect notice, of misconcepti
ons as to the true factual position 
including an 
incorrect understanding of decisions taken by Prudential™s 
Board
 and a 
failure to recognise the significance of other matters
 (including), that the 

transaction was ﬁsignifica
ntly advancedﬂ by virtue of Mr Thiam™s 

update to the Prudential 
Board 
on 11 February 2010.  In fact, matters 
were moving at a slower pace, 

asserted that the PAC executives were justified in taking the view that

did not require discussion of a speculative possible transaction, even a, FSA 
did not require discussion of a speculative possible transaction, even a

Board 
had resolved 
would not yet be disclosed by way of approach.
 (b), FSA
™s distinct lack of concern that it had not been 
informed of the 
offer which Prudential had made to acquire AIA
 in 2009. 
 This is an 
important factor in considering the reasonableness, its regulatory obligations.  An equally importan
t factor is that the 

FSA did not request that Prudential and/or PAC inform it at an earlier 

stage if such matters were in contemplation in the future.
 , if such matters were in contemplation in the future.
 (c) the FSA wrongly 
downplayed 
Prudential™s consistent intention for the 
transaction to be announced on 0
9 March 2010, rather than, not to be a relevant factor in that 

decision.  It was only relevant to wh
ether Prudential should make an 

earlier approach than was required.
 6.8. The FSA has found that:
 , of the transaction on the 
financial system
; and (ii) its transformative effect 
on the Prudential 
Group
.  When PAC™s obligations under Principle 11 are considered in 

light
 of, 

light
 of th
e size and impact of the transaction and its transformative 
effect on the Prudential Group
, it is clear (by way of example only), 

that it would have 
, to be notified
, of the 
transaction at the strategy meeting on 12 February 2010 at which 

Prudential™s strategy in Asia was discussed.
 (b)
 it was not aware of the details, s strategy in Asia was discussed.
 (b)
 it was not aware of the details regarding Prudential™s actions to 
acquire AIA in February 2009 until late in 2011.    At t
he, in February 2009 until late in 2011.    At t
he time of the 
events, neither Prudential nor AIG made any announcements about an 

offer, or the fact that they were or had been in, of the attempted earlier acquisition were raised for the first time 
on 30 

December 2011, 
in Prudential™s response 
to the preliminary 
investigation report.  
Further, at the time of the events, to the preliminary 
investigation report.  
Further, at the time of the events in 2009, 

Prudential informed the FSA that it had made no bid for AIA (when in 

fact a bid was made, had made no bid for AIA (when in 

fact a bid was made 
Œ a fact which Prudential has now sought to rely 
on).  
As a result, 
the 
assert
ion, previous attempt to acquire AIA in 2009
 is not sustainable
. (c) it has not ﬁdownplayedﬂ Prudential™s alleged consist
ent intention for 
the transaction to be announced on 09 March 2010, rather, (in the language of Principle 11) would reasonably 

have expected to be notified of it.  Prudential™s 
alleged 
subjective 
intention 
for the transaction to be announced on 09 March 2010 
, The FSA 
considers that PAC™s acknowledgement supports its finding that the 

perceived leak risk materially influenced Prudential™s judgment about 

when to inform the FSA about the transaction pursuant to Princ
iple 
11, ded that the FSA should have regard to the totality of the financial penalty 
to be levied upon the Prudential Group in assessing fairness and proportionality.
 6.12. PAC 
submitted that:
 (1)
 , )
 the FSA should have regard to the totality of the financial penalty to be 

imposed on the Prudential Group in assessing whether it is fair and 

proportional to the alleged misconduct because whilst Prudential and
 PAC, imposed on the Prudential Group in assessing whether it is fair and 

proportional to the alleged misconduct because whilst Prudential and
 PAC 
are separate entities and their alleged breaches are of different regulatory 

obligations, there is, PAC 
also 
contended that it should not receive a large financial pen
alty simply because 

the Prudential Group is large.  The FSA™s assessment of the financial 

penalty as a proportion of market, PAC
™s assertions), the deterrence 
aspect
 of the financial penalty to be imposed on Prudential is based on the 
need to deter (i) 
PAC
 from failing to deal openly and, 
 decisions that had to be made could have been taken in less
   22 time-pressured circumstances and Prudential would have likely avoided 
having to postpone the rights issue prospectus.  The FSA also notes that the, to the totality of the financial penalty to be imposed on 

the Pruden
tial Group in assessing whether Prudential™s financial penalty is 

fair and proportional to Prudential™s misconduct.  The FSA accepts that, 

the Pruden
tial Group in assessing whether Prudential™s financial penalty is 

fair and proportional to Prudential™s misconduct.  The FSA accepts that 

whilst Prudential and PAC are separate entities and their breaches, financial penalty is 

fair and proportional to Prudential™s misconduct.  The FSA accepts that 

whilst Prudential and PAC are separate entities and their breaches are of 

different regulatory obligations, there is a
 very, 
accept P
AC™s assertion that 
the proposed total financial penalty to be imposed on the Prudential Group 

is unprecedented and implies that the present case is one of the most serious 

breaches of regulatory, 6.5).  

Further, the FSA considers that the s
ize and financial resources of the 
Prudential Group is highly relevant to deterrence (which is the principal 

purpose for the imposition of the financial penalty, reasons, the FSA considers that the financial penalty to be 
imposed on 
PAC 
and on the Prudential Group as a whole, 
is 
appropriate and 
proportionate.  It properly takes into account the, 20
